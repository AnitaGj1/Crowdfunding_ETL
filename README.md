# Project: Crowdfunding ETL

## Project Description/Outline

This repository cleans and organizes the data from two Excel files containing contact information and information on crowdfunding campaigns.  Both of these Excel files were read in and converted to DataFrames using Jupyter notebooks.  After the DataFrames were organized, they were exported as CSV files that were then used to create a new database in Postgres with the CSV files being imported to SQL tables.

## Contents

Our project folder contains the following:
* A Jupyter notebook named `ETL_Mini_Project_AGjurchinovska_JHeresi_NLollin_POk.ipynb.ipynb` to clean the DataFrames
* A SQL file named 'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql' showing the creation of the tables
* A Resources folder containing the orignal Excel files and the CSV files that were exported from the Jupyter notebook
* An Output folder containing images of the dataframes and SQL tables
