# Project: Crowdfunding ETL

## Project Description/Outline

This repository cleans and organizes the data from two Excel files containing contact information and information on crowdfunding campaigns.  Both of these Excel files were read in and converted to DataFrames using Jupyter notebooks.  After the DataFrames were organized, they were exported as CSV files that were then used to create a new database in Postgres with the CSV files being imported to SQL tables.
